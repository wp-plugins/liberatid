Allow user login or registration using LiberatID service. Additionally, OpenIDs for authentication of users and comments is also supported.

== Description ==

LiberatID is an innovative site that specializes in providing secure technology choices for users to secure their online logins. LiberatID puts the control of one's identity in the individual's hands, allowing them to secure their logins in their own way.

LiberatID supports OpenID for logins. OpenID is an [open standard][] that allows users to authenticate to websites
without having to create a new password.  This plugin allows users to login to
their local WordPress account using an OpenID, as well as enabling commenters
to leave authenticated comments with OpenID.  The plugin also includes an OpenID
provider, enabling users to login to OpenID-enabled sites using their
own personal WordPress account. [XRDS-Simple][] is required for the OpenID
Provider and some features of the OpenID Consumer.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why do I get blank screens when I activate the plugin? =

In some cases the plugin may have problems if not enough memory has been
allocated to PHP.  Try ensuring that the PHP memory\_limit is at least 8MB
(limits of 64MB are not uncommon).

= Why don't `https` OpenIDs work? =

SSL certificate problems creep up when working with some OpenID providers
(namely MyOpenID).  This is typically due to an outdated CA cert bundle being
used by libcurl.  An explanation of the problem and a couple of solutions 
can be found [here][libcurl].

= Why do I get the error "Invalid openid.mode '<No mode set>'"? =

There are actually a couple of reasons that can cause this, but it seems one of
the more common causes is a conflict with certain mod_security rules.  See 
[this blog post][ioni2] for instructions on how to resolve this issue.

= How do I use SSL for OpenID transactions? =

First, be aware that this only works in WordPress 2.6 and up.  Make sure you've
turned on SSL in WordPress by [defining either of the following][wp-ssl]
globals as "true" in your `wp-config.php` file:

 - FORCE\_SSL\_LOGIN
 - FORCE\_SSL\_ADMIN

Then, also define the following global as "true" in your `wp-config.php` file:

 - OPENID\_SSL

Be aware that you will almost certainly have trouble with this if you are not
using a certificate purchased from a well-known certificate authority.

The original LiberatID plugin for WordPress was derived from the OpenID plugin authored by willnorris and factoryjoe. LiberatID, Inc. expresses their deep gratitude for their work, without which the LiberatID plugin could not have been released in record time.
